<p><strong>What Are Office Hours?</strong></p>
<p>Every Tuesday and Thursday during the semester, excluding Reading Week and any other announced absences, I (Prof. Jesse Ziter) will be available for virtual consultation to all Engineering Technical Communications Sections 1, 4, and 7 students from 8:30 to 11:00 a.m.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Do I Need to Attend Office Hours?</strong></p>
<p>Office Hours are optional. They operate on a drop-in basis: If you choose to attend, you do not need to make an appointment beforehand.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Where Is Your Office?</strong></p>
<p>For Winter 2023, Office Hours will take place in Microsoft Teams. I am happy to meet with students using videoconferencing, audio chat, or text chat (whichever you prefer!).</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>How Do I Attend Office Hours?</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of the semester, all students should have received an email with an invitation to a recurring Office Hours Microsoft Teams meeting. If you accepted this invitation, you can access Office Hours using this link.</p>
<p>Alternatively, simply use the "Direct Link to Office Hours" link in the Office Hours section of this course site.</p>
<p>Finally, if you prefer, you may select "Join with an ID" in the Teams app and enter:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40.0px;"><strong>Meeting ID:</strong> 230 961 422 972<br><strong>Passcode:</strong> BLCg3h</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40.0px;"></p>
<p><strong>Do I Need to Download Microsoft Teams?</strong></p>
<p>No. All fully registered University of Windsor students can access Microsoft Teams for free via free <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-teams/log-in">https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-teams/log-in</a> using their UWin ID and password. I recommend downloading the Teams app, but you can use a web browser if you prefer.</p></body></html>
